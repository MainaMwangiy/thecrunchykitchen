	<h2> How it Started </h2>
	<p>
	The Crunchy Kitchen is a family-owned restaurant established in January 2001. The idea of opening a restaurant came about during the Thanksgiving holiday of 2000. As the host, our family prepared a Thanksgiving meal using a traditional turkey recipe passed down from our great-grandmother, who enjoyed trying out different home-made recipes for the holiday.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	Noting the compliments from our guests about the unique and delicious meal, we decided to prepare 10 meals the following weekend using an old recipe book left behind by our great-grandparents. We shared the meals with our neighbors and sought their honest opinions, which was positive and full of praises! It is then that we decided to open a local restaurant come January 2001.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	With good luck and support from our customers, we have enhanced the recipes and develop one of the best scrumptious and healthy cuisines that has made The Crunchy Kitchen now a 4-star rated restaurant!
